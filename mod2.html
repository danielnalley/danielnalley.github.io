    <h1>Beginner Essentials in Python</h1>
   <p>
    Yo what's good everybody your boy Daniel Nalley is back to fill you in on my lastest growth. After studying while loops, functions, etc.
    for a little bit, I moved on to mathematical functions. Mathematical functions are a lot more simple than what I've studied so far, but can
    be used to create complex codes. I won't be getting into the more complex ideas yet, and we'll start of simple. Thes codes are written very
    very easily, As easy as ">>>30+30" and "60" will pop up. A lot of coding involves mathematical functions, so knowing this is almost
    a necessity really for further growth in python.

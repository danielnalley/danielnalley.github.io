    <p>
   Continuing on dealing with loops, I'm now starting to move on to if then loops. If then loops are a little more
      complicated because they also involve else code, which is a situation that occurs if the if then statement isn't true.
      If then codes are also a very beginner subject in python, but are also still important as well. It's like getting the basics down
      before you can move on to more complicated codes or even more complicated loops.

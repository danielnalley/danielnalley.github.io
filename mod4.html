    <h1>Python Dictionary</h1>
    A dictionary in python is something accessible that will tell you information you have entered. For instance
    if you entered your name to be Daniel when you searched in your dictionary for "name" Daniel would pop up. Dictionaries are
    a useful way for storing important information and keeping your code organized. Any ideas or thoughts you had
    can be kept in a dictionary. It's quite useful to know.

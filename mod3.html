    Another very commonly used feature of python is variables. Assigning variables is an easy and quick way to keep everything
    organized and easy to use. A variable is something applied to a word. For instance, assigning the string "savage" to the
    word "dab". You can use variables in coding to represent numbers too. For beginners, variables are an important piece
    to furthering knowledge and ability.

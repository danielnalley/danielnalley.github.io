      Hello once again, and for the last time, friend. Today we will be looking at a program that allows users around the world
      to connect to a server and customize a character. The characters are blocks that you can add image and script to.
      We did this as a guided module in class, and it was actually pretty fun. After, we added script to our blocks, adjusted size
      and image, and more. We did this module a while ago, and it looks like unfortunately I didn't save the exact code we used, but 
      I will provide examples like color codes I used to change the color of my avatar.
    <a href='code/module4.py' target='_blank' >Here</a> is my practice script.

    Your boy Daniel "Kimchi" Nalley is back for another module. Lets go boys! Lets go! Anyways this one is going to be about
    loops in python. A little more complicated, as it involves more code from what I've done so far, yet still a beginner concept.
    Loops can be used when creating games, and can involve while loops, for loops, or nested loops. Loops are a good way to
    repeat things without having to continuously enter code, basically doing work for you.

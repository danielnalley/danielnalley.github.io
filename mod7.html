    <p>
      For this module, I began studying Tuples in python. Tuples are sequences much like lists. The difference
      between a tuple and a list is that tuples cannot be changed, and will always mean what you make them mean.
      On another note, tuples use parentheses instead of brackets like a list or dictionary. I'm basically trying
      to extend my knowledge on certain types of lists and where one type of list is more valuable then another.

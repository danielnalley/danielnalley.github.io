      It's ya boi Daniel Nalley looking at some math script in Python, you'll find that creating equations that can be solved is very useful for a number of things.
      Using numbers in while loops, if then loops, many things really. You can think of these math equations as a building block into
      more complex codes, something often used but viewed as not as important. Well, it is important, and a lot of code uses numbers
      and mathematical equations, which is the main reason I am deciding to go over it in a module.
